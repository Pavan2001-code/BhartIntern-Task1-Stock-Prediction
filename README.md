# BharatIntern_Stock_Prediction
Task 1: Stock Prediction
-> Predicting the Reliance Stock Price using LSTM.
-> The code first imports the necessary libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Keras. Then, it loads the stock price data from a CSV file. The data is pre-processed by removing the columns that are not needed and scaling the data. 
-> The LSTM model is then created. The model is trained on the pre-processed data. After the model is trained, it is used to predict the stock prices. The predicted prices are compared to the actual prices to evaluate the performance of the model.
-> The project includes a visualization of the predicted prices and actual prices. The visualization shows that the predicted prices are generally close to the actual prices.
